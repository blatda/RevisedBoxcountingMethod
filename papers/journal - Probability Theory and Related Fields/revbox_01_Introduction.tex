A fractal is an object whose so-called fractal dimension exceeds its topological dimension and its Hausdorff dimension is non-integer at the same time. The Box Counting method [\ref{bib:Box counting}] can be used for estimating the fractal dimension due to the relationship
\begin{equation} 
\label{eq:boxcount}
\ln{C(a)} = A - D_{0}\ln{a},
\end{equation}
where $a>0$ is a box size and $C(a)$ is a number of covering elements. Capacity dimension [\ref{bib:Capacity dimension}] $D_{0}$ is estimated as a slope of the line computed by the least square method. These estimates tend to be biased especially for small values of $a$. We propose to enhance the Box Counting method by Bayesian estimation of Hartley entropy $H_{0}$, which offers better estimate of capacity dimension $D_{0}$.
