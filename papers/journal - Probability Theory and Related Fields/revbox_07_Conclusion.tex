\section {Conclusion}
In this paper we developed the Bayesian estimator $\hat{H}_{0,\mathrm{Bayes}}$ of Hartley entropy for Dirichlet prior. This estimate enables to estimate $\hat{D}_{0}$ with suppressed bias in comparison with naive box-counting estimate. The novel methodology is based on the box-counting estimate $\hat{D}_{0,\mathrm{naive}}$ which helps to specify the Dirichlet prior and finally reestimate the capacity dimension. This procedure is recommended for 2D structures with $1 \leq \hat{D}_{0} \leq 1.6$ and can be easily extended for information dimension $D_1$ estimation and higher dimensions.
