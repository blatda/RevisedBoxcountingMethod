\section {Experimental Part }

The Revisited Box Counting technique will be tested on models of deterministic self-similar 2D fractal sets. They are generated by recursive expansion of binary matrix $\mathbb{G}_{u,v} \in \{ 0, 1 \}^{v \times v} $, where $u$ a is the number of non-zero elements (units), $v>1$ is a matrix dimension, and $v<u<v^2$. \\
\\*
Recursive expansion of $\mathbb{G}_{u,v}$ generates a binary matrix which represents fractal set $\mathbb{F}_{u,v}$ of a similarity dimension $D_{\text{S}} = D_{\text{H}} = D_{0} = D_{1} = \frac{\log{u}}{\log{v}}$. Depth $h$ of recursion depends on $v$ and should be appropriate to computer memory size.\\
\\*
Four testing sets $\mathbb{F}_{3,2}$, $\mathbb{F}_{4,3}$, $\mathbb{F}_{5,3}$, $\mathbb{F}_{8,3}$ were generated by matrices:
\begin{itemize}
\item 

$\mathbb{G}_{3,2} = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 
\end{bmatrix}$ for $h=11$, $\text{dim}(\mathbb{F}_{3,2}) = \frac{\log{3}}{\log{2}} = 1.5850,$

\item 

$\mathbb{G}_{4,3} = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}$ for $h=7$, $\text{dim}(\mathbb{F}_{4,3}) = \frac{\log{4}}{\log{3}} = 1.2619,$

\item 

$\mathbb{G}_{5,3} = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & 1 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}$ for $h=7$, $\text{dim}(\mathbb{F}_{5,3}) = \frac{\log{5}}{\log{3}} = 1.4650,$

\item 

$\mathbb{G}_{8,3} = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 1 \\
1 & 1 & 1
\end{bmatrix}$ for $h=7$, $\text{dim}(\mathbb{F}_{8,3}) = \frac{\log{8}}{\log{3}} = 1.8928.$
\end{itemize}
Sets $\mathbb{G}_{3,2}$ and $\mathbb{G}_{8,3}$ correspond to Sierpinski gasket and carpet respectively. \\

At first, adequate point sets of given depth $h$ were generated. Then, they were randomly rotated around the origin, and finally they were randomly shifted. Afterwards, a grid of size $a$ was put on the data points and entropy estimates were calculated. Due to physical interpretation of entropy, the estimates were averaged over 10 realizations and mean values of entropy were calculated. \\
\\*
Various estimates of Hartley entropy for the grid of size $a=5,7,10,15,...,150,200$ are depicted in Fig \ref{fig:frac}. Hartley entropy estimates are similar to each other except for under-biased naive estimate. Estimates $H_{0,\mbox{\scriptsize{BAYES}}}$ and $H_{0,\mbox{\scriptsize{low}}}$ are very similar in these four cases. Corresponding estimates of Shannon entropy are depicted in Fig. \ref{fig:fracshan} in the same range. \\
\\*
As seen in Fig. \ref{fig:frac} and \ref{fig:fracshan}, too small grid size $a \leq 20$ comes to underestimation of $\hat{H}_{0,\mbox{\scriptsize{naive}}}, \hat{H}_{1,\mbox{\scriptsize{naive}}}$, but the other estimates are unfortunately overestimated. Therefore, Revisited Box Counting was applied in the range $30 \leq a \leq 100$.\\
\\*
Using the least square method we obtained various estimates of $D_{0}$ and $D_{1}$ and got a chance to compare them with theoretical values of similarity dimension. The results of estimation are collected in Tabs. \ref{tab:est1} - \ref{tab:est4s}, where $\text{E}D$ is point estimate of a given dimension, $s_{D}$ is its standard deviation, and $p_{\text{value}}$ is probability from t-test of hypothesis
\begin{equation} 
\label{eq:hypo}
\text{H}_{0} : \text{E}D = D_{\text{S}}.
