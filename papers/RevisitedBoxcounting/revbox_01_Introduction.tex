Fractals are objects, which exceed its topological dimensions and its Hausdorff dimension is not integer. Box Counting method is used for estimating fractal dimension in the form
\begin{equation} 
\label{eq:boxcount}
\ln{C(a)} = A - D_{0}\ln{a},
\end{equation}
where $a>0$ is box size and $C(a)$ is number of covering elements. Capacity dimension $D_{0}$ is estimated as slope of the line which is generated by least square method. These estimate is biased especialy for small values of $a$. Box Counting method can be improved by Bayesian estimation of Hartley entropy $H_{0}$, which offers better estimate of capacity dimension $D_{0}$.
